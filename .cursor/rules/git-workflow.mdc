# Git Workflow Rules

## Branching Strategy

- **main** - Stable releases only. All tags are created from this branch.
- **develop** - Active development. Features and fixes are merged here first.

## Release Process

1. Complete work on `develop` branch
2. Create PR from `develop` to `main`
3. Merge PR after review
4. Create tag on `main` branch (never on develop)

## Tagging

- Tags must ALWAYS be created from the `main` branch
- Use semantic versioning: `vX.Y.Z`
- Include release notes in tag annotation

```bash
git checkout main
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z - Description"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

## Never Do

- Never create tags on `develop` branch
- Never push directly to `main` (use PRs)
- Never skip the develop → main merge flow for releases
